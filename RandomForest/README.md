## 🏥 Treatment Plan Features

Each assessment now generates comprehensive treatment plans including:

### 🚨 Immediate Actions
- Program enrollment recommendations
- Urgent medical interventions
- Clinical assessments needed

### 🍽️ Personalized Nutrition Plans
- **SAM patients**: RUTF sachets (1 per kg body weight), 500 cal/sachet
- **MAM patients**: Supplementary feeding (75 kcal/kg/day)
- Age-appropriate feeding schedules and frequencies

### 💊 Medical Interventions
- **Vitamin A**: 200,000 IU (>12 months) or 100,000 IU (<12 months)
- **Iron + Folate**: 2-6 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks
- **Antibiotics**: Amoxicillin protocols for SAM cases
- **Deworming**: Age-appropriate protocols

### 📊 Monitoring Schedules
- **SAM**: Daily monitoring during stabilization, weekly during rehabilitation
- **MAM**: Weekly visits first month, then bi-weekly
- **Normal**: Monthly growth monitoring

### 🎯 Success Criteria
- **Weight gain targets**: ≥5g/kg/day for SAM, ≥3g/kg/day for MAM
- **Anthropometric improvements**: WHZ score targets
- **Discharge criteria**: Evidence-based graduation standards

### 🚨 Emergency Protocols
- Warning signs requiring immediate medical attention
- Family education on danger signs
- When to seek urgent care

## 💡 Integration Example

To add treatment planning to your existing assessment:

```python
# Your existing code (unchanged)
ml_result = your_random_forest_predict(patient_data)
who_result = your_who_assessment(patient_data)
risk_result = your_risk_assessment(patient_data)

# Add treatment planning (3 lines!)
from personalized_treatment_planner import PersonalizedTreatmentPlanner
planner = PersonalizedTreatmentPlanner()
treatment_plan = planner.generate_comprehensive_treatment_plan(
    patient_data, ml_result, risk_result, who_result
)

# Now you have complete clinical protocols!
```
